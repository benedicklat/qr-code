## Overview

This simple project contains a challenge which is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The main programming language used was primarily HTML & CSS.

## My process

1. Initialized the process by studying the codes already included
2. Analyzed the possible designs to be used for the project.
3. Committed changes by basic codings and my own understanding about html and css.
4. When there are things I don't understand, I got help online.
5. Saved the project in my own Github repository and submitted the solution.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Google FONT API


### What I learned

Here, I have learned to recall the basic HTML and CSS coding and apply to it this project. No matter how hard the codings is, I have to
show the perseverance to learn and discover my passion here.

CODE SNIPPETS:

```html
<div class="card">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>

    <h5>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</h5>
  </div>
```
```css
.card {
    background-color: white;
    width: 280px;
    height: 450px;
    margin: auto;
    margin-top: 150px;
    border-radius: 25px;
```


### Continued development

I am looking forward to dive deeper in programming setup and understand more about them.
